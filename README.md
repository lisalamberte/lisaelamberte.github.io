## BACKGROUND

I am a seasoned Research Fellow with over a decade of experience in microbiome research, molecular microbiology, and microbial genomics, genetics, biochemistry, and physiology. My expertise spanning various research domains, prominently including the investigation of microbial communities in both infant gut microbiomes and tree ecosystems. My extensive contributions include pioneering research into the complex interplay between *Staphylococcus haemolyticus* and antibiotic resistance within the preterm infant gut, shedding light on crucial aspects of microbial ecology and human health. My work has led to significant advances in understanding microbial dynamics, earning recognition as a dedicated scientist and an excellent communicator. I have been an invited speaker at prestigious international conferences and have authored impactful publications, elucidating critical insights into the intricate mechanisms of microbial adaptation and resilience. Currently, I am also building my expertise in fungal biology and ecology. With my multifaceted skill set and a passion for exploring the intricate world of microbiomes, I aim to continue to inspire the scientific community through my research, emphasizing the pivotal role of microbial ecosystems in shaping our understanding of health and the environment. I am especially interested in emplowering scientists from developing countries by amplifying their voices and expertise. 

## CORE SKILLS

- Extensive research experience in microbiome research, molecular microbiology, microbial genomics, genetics, biochemistry, and physiology
- Effective communication of complex scientific data and concepts across a broad range of levels, from senior level scientists to undergraduate students.

- Expertise in the delivery of effective oral presentations to large (conferences) and small groups (group meetings). 
- Experience in designing my own teaching session on a laboratory practical
- Experience in coordinating projects between academic and non-academic entities 

## WORK EXPERIENCE

**University of Birmingham (March 2024 - Present)**  
*Research Fellow* (Laboratory of Dr Graeme Kettles)

Currently, I am investigating the evolutionary mechanisms of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici, focusing on its adaptation to overcome wheat resistance. Additionally, I contribute to science outreach efforts by serving as an invited researcher for Science Day at the School of Education, where I engage young students, particularly 7–8-year-olds, and share insights about the role of female scientists. I also presented my research findings at the Microbiology Society Annual Conference 2024 in Edinburgh, enriching the scientific discourse in my field.

**University of Birmingham (February 2023 – February 2024)**  
*Research Fellow* (Laboratory of Prof. Robert Jackson)

In this role, I led various projects, including the DiversiTree Work Package 2, focusing on ecosystem functionality and tree resilience. I organized and executed field trips for leaf sampling in Yorkshire and Inverness and coordinated an in planta infection assay experiment involving a team of researchers. Furthermore, I actively participated in public engagement activities and interdisciplinary events, contributing to the dissemination of scientific knowledge and fostering collaboration across different domains.

**University of Birmingham (December 2017 – February 2023)**  
*Research Fellow* (Laboratory of Prof. Willem van Schaik)

In this role, I investigated mobile antibiotic resistance genes in the gut microbiome of preterm infants. My contributions led to successful grant funding and publications in high-impact journals. Additionally, I played an active role in public engagement initiatives, including delivering seminars and organizing family-friendly activities. I also supervised and trained undergraduate and postgraduate students, facilitated workshops, and represented postdoctoral researchers at both institutional and college levels.

**University of Birmingham (April 2016 – November 2017)**  
*Research Fellow* (Laboratory of Prof. David Grainger)			

In this role, I authored publications in prestigious scientific journals and contributed to a book chapter. My work focused on molecular biology and biochemistry, where I gained extensive laboratory experience. I successfully set up laboratory facilities and managed laboratory operations, including procurement and risk assessment.

**University of Birmingham (September 2012 – July 2016)**  
*PhD Biosciences student* (Laboratory of Prof. David Grainger)		

In this role, in addition to investigating intragenic transcription and its regulation in *Escherichia coli*, I served as a laboratory demonstrator and assessor for undergraduate genetics courses. I also underwent teaching training and facilitated workshops on scientific paper reading and core mathematics. These experiences enhanced my skills in science education and communication.

**University of the Philippines – Diliman (September 2009 – February 2012)**  
*Research Assistant* (Marine Natural Products Laboratory) 

In this role, I conducted research on mammalian cell culture and influenza virus propagation. I managed project funds, coordinated with collaborators, and organized scientific discussions. Additionally, I reviewed laboratory protocols and conducted inventory management, contributing to the smooth operation of research activities.
