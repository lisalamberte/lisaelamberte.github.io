## BACKGROUND

I am a seasoned Research Fellow with over a decade of experience in microbiome research, molecular microbiology, and microbial genomics, genetics, biochemistry, and physiology. My expertise spanning various research domains, prominently including the investigation of microbial communities in both infant gut microbiomes and tree ecosystems. My extensive contributions include pioneering research into the complex interplay between *Staphylococcus haemolyticus* and antibiotic resistance within the preterm infant gut, shedding light on crucial aspects of microbial ecology and human health. My work has led to significant advances in understanding microbial dynamics, earning recognition as a dedicated scientist and an excellent communicator. I have been an invited speaker at prestigious international conferences and have authored impactful publications, elucidating critical insights into the intricate mechanisms of microbial adaptation and resilience. Currently, I am also building my expertise in fungal biology and ecology. With my multifaceted skill set and a passion for exploring the intricate world of microbiomes, I aim to continue to inspire the scientific community through my research, emphasizing the pivotal role of microbial ecosystems in shaping our understanding of health and the environment. I am especially interested in emplowering scientists from developing countries by amplifying their voices and expertise.
